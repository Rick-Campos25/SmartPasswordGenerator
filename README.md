This Python application generates personalized password suggestions based on user-provided answers to fun and meaningful questions. It uses a graphical user interface (GUI) to collect user inputs, then combines these inputs to produce password options at varying strength levels (Simple, Medium, and Strong). If the user provides no inputs, the app will still generate random strong passwords as a fallback.


Libraries Used:
- tkinter (for GUI interface)
- tkinter.messagebox (for user notifications)
- PIL / Pillow (to load and display a background image)
- random and string (for generating secure passwords)

Features:
- Interactive questionnaire to tailor password suggestions
- Simple, Medium, and Strong password generation logic
- Fallback to random strong passwords if no input is provided
- Background image support to enhance visual appeal

Note:
- The background image file must be named `PImage.jpeg` and placed in the same directory as the script.
- Passwords are generated dynamically based on user input and random elements, making them harder to guess.
